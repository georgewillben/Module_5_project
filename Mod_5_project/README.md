Hello I am George Bennett and this is my module five project for Flat Iron School.

In this project I used machine learning models to classify radio signals on whether or not they are from pulsar stars.

There are six files beside this one in the directory. They are listed here.

* Data_Science_Process.png an image explaining the data science process which I used in this project.

* Executive_Summary_Presentation.pdf a high level overview of the project created for company stake holders.

* pulsar_stars.csv contains the data I used for the project. It is from the HTRU2 Dataset. The data was collected from the High Time Resolution Universe Survey. I got it from kaggle.com

* The next three files are jupyter notebooks containing code for the project. These are aimed for fellow data scientists. Each notebook uses a different machine learning algorithm. The file name for these notebooks contain the precision, f1 score, accuracy, and AUC for the model they contain.

** DecisionTree_precision_80_f1_84_acc_97_auc_96.ipynb uses a decision tree as the classifier

** RandomForest_precision_83_f1_86_acc_97_auc_97.ipynb uses a random forest classifier

** XGB_precision_81_f1_85_acc_97_auc_97.ipynb uses a XGBoost classifier. The model in this notebook performed the best out of all three.
